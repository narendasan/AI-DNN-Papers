  - Presents an approach using linear scaling of learning rates based on batch size (**RULE:** When minibatch size is scaled by _k_, scale the learning rate by _k_ where k is the number of nodes in the cluster) and a "warmup" period at the beginning of training using a low learning rate to avoid initial optimization difficulties thereby allowing the use of large batch sizes in training, leading to equivilent generalization accuracy as well as matching training curves in a fraction of the time for ImageNet Classification with ResNet

  - Introduces the concepts of Deformable Convolutions and Deformable Region of Interest (RoI) Pooling. Both can be dropped in place of standard components in current CNNs, and can be trained with standard back propogation. Standard convolutions are fixed geometrically and so require large ammounts of training or complex model parameters to learn robust representations. Other fixed techniques like SIFT and sliding window rely on tranformation invariant features. Convolution's modeling capablity comes from large amounts of data augmentation and additional hand crafted components like max pooling to address small translation invariance. CNNs are limited to large transformations due to the fixed geometric structure of the modules e.g. Max Pooling reduces the resolution by a fixed ammount or RoI createsfixed bins. The paper introduces a new set of learned parameters for convolutional layers that correspond to offsets from the regular grid sampling locations. The offsets are learned by the feature maps in the preivious layers, via additional convolution layers. Deformable RoI Pooling addes an offset to the normal bin partition of the preivous pooling layer. These offsets are also learned. Deformable Convolution has 2 steps. 1. samples using the regular grid augmented with the trained offsets over the input feature map 2. sampled values are summed and weighted. To learn the offsets, gradients are backproped. Deformable RoI takes a input feature map and a dRoI of size _w_x_h_ and a top left corner and splits the RoI into _k_x_k_ bins each offset from the RoI bin position by a learned offset. The output feature map is the collection of bins created by the dRoI. The offsets are learned via a fully connected layer which applies the offsets on a standard RoI.

    - Presents a method for image to image translation without paired examples.
Does This by learning the key characteristics of a set X and a set Y and then
tries to develop a translation function to apply the key characteristics. Trains
the GAN using a cycle consistancy loss (f(g(X)) -> X) and an adversarial loss.

   - Presents an approach to multitask learning leveraging the homoscedastic unceartainty of output data to learn the mixing ratios of the various objectives in contrast to the standard hand tuning of mixing ratios. With the mixing ratios being learned, it could now be feasible to increase the number of tasks a model can learn. The paper shows a model using this approach trained on per-pixel depth regression, and semantic and instance segmantation that outpreforms single task models.

  - ELF is a framework for training RL agents on games. It allows researchers to define their own games or wrap existing ones and access them through a python interface. It supports multiple executions of a game and/or multiple agents and batched game states. The paper also does some experiements on the traning of RL agents on games similar to starcraft using ELF and find that with ELF a computer with 6 cores and a GPU and a a day one can train a RL agent that can beat a rule based AI 70% of the time. They show that **curriculum training** is important in training agents. They use the strategy of letting the rule-based AI play *k* ticks where *k~Uniform(0,1000)* then they switch to the agent. This serves to reduce the difficulty of the game initally and allows the state to vary more. Gradually the size of *k* is reduced until the agent is standalone. Finally, the examine **Monte Carlo Tree Search** where off the current game state, new potential game states are explored via self play, focusing on paths that give the agent the highest win rate. They show that MCTS can get a similar win percentage to RL agents but to do so it must have the whole game state (i.e. no fog of ware), where as RL does not, it also needs knowledge of the game mechanics and even then it is still slower.

  - Original Convnet paper using GPUs. Describes a 8 layer Convnet (5 conv, 3 fc), use of Relu to avoid the saturation problem of tanh as well as its benifits in avoiding overfitting. Descibes an early multi gpu implementation and use of dropout to again avoid overfitting. SoA at the time on ImageNet with a large margin.

  - Tackles the problem of domain shift for DNNs, (low level feature extractors being so finely tuned to one set of image processing steps, lighting etc. cause the network to perform worse in domains that do not conform to those constraints). Classical method is fine tuning, using labeled training data from the target domain to retrain the low level feature extractors. ADDA is a unsupervised technique that leverages the GAN construction to fine tune a network. Uses a discriminator to differentiate between frozen network trained on the source domain with lots of data and a copy (unconnected) of the source network shown unlabeled data from the target domain when fed the logits output of each network. The idea is the discriminator loss will nudge the target network to be able to mimic the source networks domain of outputs to the point where the discriminator cannot tell the difference between the two networks. Then using the classifier of the source network, in theory (and in the experiments shown) you can preform accurate classification on the target domain.
